# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the golang versions are supported. When there is a new version of the updater the older version of the Modpack-updater is automatically marked end-of-life and will not get any security updates. Unless there is a exception but that will be stated for example a massive overhaul of the updater.

The Node.JS version of Modpack-Updater is end-of-life and should no longer be used anymore due to too many dependency's having security issues.
The golang version does not use any 3rd-party dependency's.
